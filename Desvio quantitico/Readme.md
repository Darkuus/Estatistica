Amplitude Total = Max - Min
Desvio Quantitico


[-20, -1, -8, -12, 0, 5, 7, 14, 25]
ordenar em ordem 


Q1 = (n + 1) / 4
Q2 = ((n + 1) * 2) / 4
Q3 = ((n + 1) * 3) / 4

n is the length of the array 

n = 9

Q1 = 2.5
Q2 = 5
Q2 = 7.5

Get the place in array if there was between a place get them both and make (n1 + n2) / 2

In the case of 2 big companies getting together and merging. 
The bigger the amplitude the more costs the companie A has, this case splits up in 25% 
in this range the part that has the biggest amplitude get fired and keeps the lower one.


Desvio interquartitico = (Q3 - Q1)
gets what's in the center
